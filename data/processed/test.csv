 providing an aircraft comprising a cargo area containing at least one package and at least one unmanned aerial vehicle;   flying the aircraft to a location; and   releasing the at least one unmanned aerial vehicle from the cargo area while the aircraft is flying or hovering, wherein the at least one package is secured to the at least one unmanned aerial vehicle."
US-11357746-B2,A23L33/10,"The present invention relates to use of a composition comprising D-glyceric acid (DGA), DL-glyceric acid, L-glyceric acid, or hydroxypyruvatic acid and/or their salts or esters. Further, the invention relates to the use of said composition for enhancing direct and indirect mitochondrial metabolism, e.g. the ATP producing electron transport system (ETS), citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle, (TCA), and beta oxidation, and also enhancing the shuttling of reducing equivalents from mitochondrial matrix into the cytosol and protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum. Directly related to the above the use of DGA relates also to reducing the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Alleviating, preventing and even healing effects towards extremely wide range of non-communicable diseases materializes.","1. A method of increasing direct or indirect mitochondrial activity, RNA expression of genes encoding ETS related genes, TCA activity, and/or biogenesis of new mitochondria in a subject comprising administering a composition comprising an effective amount of one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of D-glyceric acid, DL-glyceric acid, L-glyceric acid, hydroxypyruvic acid, a salt of D-glyceric acid, a salt of DL-glyceric acid, and a salt of L-glyceric acid to a subject in need, wherein the composition enhances mitochondrial ATP production and simultaneously reduces excessive radical oxygen species formation from OXPHOS, and furthermore can increase cellular capacity to adjust cytosolic NAD+/NADH− ratio in timely manner when needed, and wherein the composition is administered via an oral application route."
